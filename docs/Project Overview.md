# üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
---

The Lodestone project has three components.

- **Lodestone Core** is the backend service the end-users deploy on their machine. 
    - Communicates with the frontend dashboard and handles user management, authentication, game server management and file management. 
    - Lodestone Core is available for download via the project‚Äôs GitHub Release page, or via the Lodestone CLI.
    - Lodestone Core does not have the ability to auto-update, that functionality is instead delegated to the Lodestone CLI.    
- **Dashboard** is the UI the end-users interact with to perform actions on the connected core.
    - A user can access the dashboard as a web application hosted at lodestone.cc, or they can choose to host it themselves either by cloning the repository or by using the provided Docker image.
- **Lodestone Desktop** bundles the dashboard and core into an installable desktop app. 
    - The desktop client has an updater built-in, which prompts the user whether they want to update when there is a new release.

#### CLI

Additionally, the project also provides a command line tool to aid the end-users in their deployment of Lodestone Core.

#### Branching

The repository contains 2 major branches: `main` and `dev`. 

* The `main` branch contains code in the latest stable release.
* The `dev` branch contains code in the latest beta release. 

After a beta version is deemed stable enough, it is merged into the main branch.
