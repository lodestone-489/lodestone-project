📚 docs/        
A basic MkDocs project lives in `docs/`. All the `*.md` make up sections in the documentation.

⚙️ .readthedocs.yaml        
Read the Docs Build configuration is stored in `.readthedocs.yaml`.

⚙️ mkdocs.yml       
A [MkDocs configuration](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/) is stored here, including a few extensions for MkDocs and Markdown. Add your own configurations here, such as extensions and themes. Remember that many extensions and themes require additional Python packages to be installed.

📍 docs/requirements.txt and docs/requirements.in       
Python dependencies are [pinned](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/reproducible-builds.html) (uses [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) here. Make sure to add your Python dependencies to `requirements.txt` or if you choose [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), edit `docs/requirements.in` and remember to run to run `pip-compile docs/requirements.in`.
