This example shows a basic MkDocs project with Read the Docs. You're encouraged to view it to get inspiration and copy & paste from the files in the source code. If you are using Read the Docs for the first time, have a look at the official [Read the Docs Tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html).

üìö [docs/](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/docs/)<br>
A basic MkDocs project lives in `docs/`, it was generated using MkDocs defaults. All the `*.md` make up sections in the documentation.

‚öôÔ∏è [.readthedocs.yaml](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/.readthedocs.yaml)<br>
Read the Docs Build configuration is stored in `.readthedocs.yaml`.

‚öôÔ∏è [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/mkdocs.yml)<br>
A basic [MkDocs configuration](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/) is stored here, including a few extensions for MkDocs and Markdown. Add your own configurations here, such as extensions and themes. Remember that many extensions and themes require additional Python packages to be installed.

üìç [docs/requirements.txt](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/docs/requirements.txt) and [docs/requirements.in](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/docs/requirements.in)<br>
Python dependencies are [pinned](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/reproducible-builds.html) (uses [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) here. Make sure to add your Python dependencies to `requirements.txt` or if you choose [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), edit `docs/requirements.in` and remember to run to run `pip-compile docs/requirements.in`.

üí° [docs/api.md](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/docs/api.md)<br>
We add our example Python module `lumache` in order to auto-generate an API reference. To do this, we use the `:::` syntax, you can read more in the [mkdocstrings documentation](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/).

üí° [docs/usage.md](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/docs/usage.md)<br>
We also include some direct links to a function from the API reference, as well as embedding documentation for the example function `lumache.get_random_recipe`. This functionality is also from the [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/) extension.

üí° [lumache.py](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/lumache.py)<br>
API docs are generated for this example Python module - they use *docstrings* directly in the documentation, notice how this shows up in the rendered documentation. We use the [Sphinx convention](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html#function-definitions) for docstrings, however you are free to edit `mkdocs.yml` to change this option to `google` or `numpy`.

üî¢ Git tags versioning<br>
We use a basic versioning mechanism by adding a git tag for every release of the example project. All releases and their version numbers are visible on
[example-mkdocs-basic.readthedocs.io](https://example-mkdocs-basic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

üìú [README.md](https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-mkdocs-basic/blob/main/README.md)<br>
Contents of this `README.md` are visible on Github and included on [the documentation index page](https://example-mkdocs-basic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Don\'t Repeat Yourself).
