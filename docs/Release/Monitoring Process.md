#### Reporting Issues
If a user encounters issues while using any of Lodestone‚Äôs products, they can file an issue on the project repository. Maintainers will be notified of an issue‚Äôs creation by email and by Discord via a webhook in the internal Lodestone Team Discord server. A user can also start a thread in the support-forum channel in the public Lodestone community Discord server.

#### Logging
Lodestone Core is equipped with the tracing logging framework, which records logs to the user‚Äôs file system. A user can choose to include this log when submitting an issue to better aid in the developer‚Äôs investigation.
